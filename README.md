To create a Python-based Number Guessing Game where users try to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range, hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:
1. Define the Project Structure:
Generate Random Number: Use Python's random module to generate a number within a specified range.
User Input: Allow the user to guess the number.
Feedback Loop: Provide feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
Limit Attempts (Optional): Optionally, restrict the number of attempts the user has.
2. Import Required Modules:
You will need the random module to generate random numbers.
3. Set Up the Main Game Function:
The main function will handle the entire game logic, from generating the number to processing user guesses.
4. Implement Additional Features (Optional):
Difficulty Levels: Allow the user to select the difficulty level, which will adjust the range of the random number and/or the number of allowed attempts.
Replay Option: After the game ends, ask the user if they would like to play again.
5. Main Function:
The main function will call number_guessing_game() to start the game.
6. Running the Game:
When you run the program, the game will prompt the user to guess a number. The program will then provide feedback after each guess and will end once the user guesses correctly or runs out of attempts.
Project Enhancements:
Difficulty Settings: Add options for the user to choose from easy, medium, and hard modes.
Leaderboard: Track and display the best scores.
Hints: Provide hints after each guess (e.g., whether the number is odd or even).
This project will help you gain practical experience with user input handling, loops, conditionals, and the random module in Python.
